Define a global UI style system using Tailwind CSS for the Fluffly email platform.

Base visual identity:
- Brand style: soft neo-brutalism
- Mascot: koala (used visually, not coded)
- Primary color: #FEE440 (banana yellow)
- Text color: #1E1E1E (dark gray)
- Background color: #FCFCFC (almost white)
- Accent color: #C084FC (soft lilac)

Global styling rules:
- Use clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter or system default)
- Headings should be bold and large
- Text should always have high contrast with background
- Buttons:
  - Primary: use the yellow color, darken slightly on hover
  - Secondary: white with dark border, hover with soft lilac background
- Cards and UI blocks:
  - Light backgrounds with dark borders (1-2px)
  - Medium padding (p-4 or p-6)
  - Slight corner rounding (rounded-md or lg)
- Inputs:
  - Full width, white background, outlined, focus ring in accent color
- Hover states:
  - Buttons and interactive items should use shadow or color darkening

Apply this theme consistently across all pages and components. Assume this is the design system for the entire project.
